# EOMT Panoptic Segmentation App

A Gradio-based web application for interactive panoptic segmentation using the **EOMT (Encoder-only Mask Transformer)** model - a minimalist approach that repurposes a plain Vision Transformer (ViT) for image segmentation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Gradio interface for uploading and processing images
- **Multiple Visualization Types**:
  - Segmentation mask with color-coded segments
  - Overlay visualization on original image
  - Contour detection and boundary analysis
  - Individual instance masks in grid layout
  - Edge detection highlighting
  - Segment isolation for detailed analysis
  - Boundary density heatmap visualization
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast inference with CUDA support and proper GPU memory handling
- **Sample Images**: Built-in sample images with intuitive button selection
- **Detailed Analytics**: Comprehensive segment statistics and visual analysis

## üß† Model

This application uses the **EOMT (Encoder-only Mask Transformer)** model, as presented in the CVPR 2025 highlight paper ["Your ViT is Secretly an Image Segmentation Model"](https://www.tue-mps.org/eomt/):

- **Model ID**: `tue-mps/coco_panoptic_eomt_large_640`
- **Task**: Panoptic Segmentation
- **Dataset**: COCO Panoptic
- **Input Size**: 640x640 (automatically resized)
- **Architecture**: Plain Vision Transformer (ViT) repurposed for segmentation
- **Key Innovation**: No adapters, no decoders - just the ViT encoding image patches and segmentation queries as tokens
- **Performance**: Up to 4√ó faster than complex methods while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy

**Note**: This application requires a GPU for optimal performance. CPU inference is supported but will be significantly slower. For newer NVIDIA GPUs, use PyTorch nightly builds for best compatibility. The app includes proper CUDA tensor handling to prevent memory-related errors.

**Research**: This implementation is based on the CVPR 2025 paper ["Your ViT is Secretly an Image Segmentation Model"](https://www.tue-mps.org/eomt/) by Kerssies et al., demonstrating that plain Vision Transformers can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance.
