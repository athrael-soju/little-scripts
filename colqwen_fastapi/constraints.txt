# Pin your Torch/TorchVision builds here to prevent other deps from changing them.
# Use either exact versions (Option A) or exact wheel URLs (Option B).
# After you set these, Docker will use them as constraints when installing other packages.

# Option A: pin by version (edit to your chosen versions)
torch==2.8.0
torchvision==0.23.0

# Option B: pin exact wheel URLs (safest)
